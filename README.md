# Git Branches Helper

* Interactive UI to view and switch branches
* Sorting by recently used
* Fuzzy search
* Fuzzy switch: `git jump hlw` ‚Üí `git switch hello-world`
* Uses native `git switch` under the hood, supports all its parameters

## Install

```shell
npm install -g git-jump
```
or using Homebrew
```shell
brew tap mykolaharmash/git-jump
brew install git-jump
```

## Usage

```shell
git jump
```
Run without arguments to launch [interactive UI](#How-It-Looks-In-Action).

* At first, branches are not sorted. Once you start switching around, `git jump` will track the history and sort the list, so that the most recently used branches are at the top and can be accessed faster.
* Navigate the list with ‚Üì‚Üë arrows and hit enter ‚èé to switch into selected branch.
* On the left hand side of the list you'll see a number next to a brunch name. Use <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>\<number\></kbd> for quick switch (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>\<number\></kbd> on Windows and Linux).
* Start typing to filter the list. The search is fuzzy, you don't have to be precise.
* Ctrl+C to exit.

<br />

```shell
git jump <branch name>
```
Switches to a branch. `<branch name>` can be just part of the name, `git jump` will look for the best matching branch.

<br />

```shell
git jump [--list | -l]
```
Shows a plain list of branches without interactive UI but with sorting.

<br />

```shell
git jump <any native switch arguments>
```

You can use `git jump` as a drop-in replacement for [native `git switch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch). `git jump` will proxy all the argument to the native command, so you don't have to think to use one or the other.

For example `git jump my-branch --discard-changes` works just fine.

<br />

```shell
git jump new <branch name>
```
Creates a new branch and switches into it. Supports all native parameters of `git switch`, for example `git jump new <branch name> --track origin/main`.

<br />

```shell
git jump rename <branch name> <new branch name>
```
Renames a branch.

<br />

```shell
git jump delete <branch name> [<branch name>, ...]
```
Deletes one or multiple branches. No fuzzy matching here, of course üôÇ.
